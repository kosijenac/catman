# Catman
The game of Catman (like Pacman, but the ghosts are cats, and Pacman is also a cat, hence Catman) written in C++ with the help of the SFML graphics library.

Arrow keys are used to move Catman around the maze, `make run` compiles and starts the game, and `make del` deletes the `.o` and `.exe` files.
